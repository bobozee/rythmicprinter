To add a new valid piece to be rythmically printed, create a .json file and call it whatever you'd like

The Json needs three properties: text, rythm and speed.

Text is simply the text that is to be printed out. {your text} defines one line, while adding another curly brace ({{ at the beginning) signifies the start of a new stanza.
Make sure to start your Text with a new stanza before anything.

Rythm is the sequence of notes that composes the timing of the printing. Each digit represents one note, with each digit's value representing the length of the note.
1 would equate to a whole note, 2 to a half note, 3 to a half note with a dot, 4 to a quarter note, etc up to 8 as far as I know.

Speed is simply the speed of the rythm measured in bpm.
